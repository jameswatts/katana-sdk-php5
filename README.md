KATANA SDK for PHP5
=========================

[badges]

PHP5 SDK to interface with the **KATANA**â„¢ framework (https://katana.kusanagi.io).

Requirements
------------

* KATANA Framework 1.0+
* [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/)
* [zmq extension](https://github.com/mkoppanen/php-zmq)
* [msgpack extension](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-php)

Installation
------------

The PHP5 SDK can be installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
composer install kusanagi/katana-sdk-php5
```

*Installation instructions for the SDK, such as package manager, running tests, etc*

Configuration
-------------

*(optional) Configuration of the SDK, including engine variables, environment variables or other configuration options*

Getting Started
---------------

The SDK allow both **services** and **middlewares** to be created. Both of them require a source file and a configuration file pointing to it.

The first thing to do in the source file is to include the autoloader, then define the actions and run the component.


The following example illustrate how to create a **service**.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$service = new \Katana\Sdk\Service();

$service->action('action_name', function (\Katana\Sdk\Action $action) {
    $action->log('Start action');
    
    return $action;
});

$service->run();
```

The following example illustrate how to create a request **middleware**.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$middleware = new \Katana\Sdk\Middleware();

$middleware->request(function (\Katana\Sdk\Request $request) {
    $request->log('Start Request');
    
    return $request;
});

$middleware->run();
```

*Brief example of how to use the SDK in the implementation language*

Examples
--------

One common responsibility of the request **middlewares** is routing request to the **service** actions. For this the **middleware** should set the target **service**, version and action.

```php
<?php

$middleware->request(function (\Katana\Sdk\Request $request) {
    $request->setServiceName('service');
    $request->setServiceVersion('1.0.0');
    $request->setActionName('action');
    
    return $request;
});

$middleware->run();
```

Response **middlewares** commonly format the data in the transport to present a response.

```php
<?php

$middleware->response(function (\Katana\Sdk\Response $response) {
    
    return $response;
});

$middleware->run();
```
